security change needed in proxy.go

need to make it so that requests to apis will only be served if user is internal

after im sure that i did it correct i will flip the logic so that internal users will be treated
like external, i will know that ive done it right when the rules for the endpoints work, and 
that with the flipped logic internal requests cant trigger apis, then when it isnt flipped i can
access the internal apis, which should mean the logic is correct
