# Web-security-app
- [ ] Web security program
- [ ] Locally installed 
 
- [ ] Don’t allow files to write themselves

- [ ] Require password perms even from shell or terminal

- [ ] Extra:
- [ ] Idk if this is local but it sends requests through dummy server in vm then checks if the response is unique or if it gets let through, and checks if there is anything dynamic with the inputs that isn’t typical, not sure how I would make this at all but yeah
